# 🎵 Adding Music to Your Galaxy

## Quick Start - 3 Easy Ways

### Option 1: Use the Built-in Procedural Music (Already Working!)
✅ **Nothing to do!** The system auto-generates space ambient music.
- Just toggle the music switch ON
- Adjust volume with the slider
- Enjoy the cosmic sounds!

### Option 2: Add Free Music (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Download free space music from:
- https://pixabay.com/music/search/space%20ambient/
- https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary (Search: "space ambient")
- https://freemusicarchive.org/genre/Ambient

**Step 2:** Rename your file to `space-music.mp3`

**Step 3:** Copy it to this folder (`assets/`)

**Step 4:** Reload the page - Music plays automatically!

### Option 3: Quick Test Music

Want to test immediately? Use this free track:
1. Go to: https://pixabay.com/music/ambient-space-120280/
2. Download the MP3
3. Rename to `space-music.mp3`
4. Place in this folder

## 📁 Supported Formats
- ✅ MP3 (best compatibility)
- ✅ OGG (Firefox/Chrome)
- ✅ WAV (large files)

## 🎧 Recommendations
- **Duration:** 2-5 minutes (loops automatically)
- **Style:** Ambient, atmospheric, drone
- **Volume:** The system auto-adjusts, but quieter is better
- **File size:** Keep under 5MB for faster loading

## ⚠️ Don't Have Music?
No problem! The procedural music (Web Audio API) works great without any files.
